	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<div id="description">
		<b>OverView</b>
		<br>
		This project uses the THREE.js library to create a scene of a mini universe. Models used within the scene are borrowed online and are implemented into the scene with GLTFLoader. 
		The scene is composed of 3 light sources (2 point light and 1 ambient light) as well as a perspective camera for viewing. Orbital control is implemented for user control, which includes arrow key or mouse key for panning. 
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Animations</b>
		<br>
		Models are rotated/translated/scaled to fit the scene. Animation of models, such as planet rotations or planet trajectory are done using the rotation attribute and Matrix4 multiplication in the requestAnimation loop. 
		AnimationMixer is utilized to enable models with inherent animation, such as the fire model(used as the fire from the rocket engine).
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Additional Functions</b>
		<br>
		Users can click on any model in the scene to randomize the color of that object's material. This is done by using RayCaster to compare mouse position and object position. Users can also click on Earth to get a closeup look at the planet. Local php server is setup to run the code without CORS error.

		<h2>Op-Ed</h2>
		Through this project, I learned many useful applications for 3d models and how convient/powerful THREE.js for creating 3d worlds. 
		The library allows anyone to easily implement 3d models and apply animations with ease. Functions within the library are very straight forward and easy to implement. I quickly learned how to utilize RayCasting to allow for user interation with moving objects in real time.
		I also learned how to use AnimationMixer to enable inherent animation of objects allowing for a more realistic experience.
		However, I also encountered many issues during this project. Firstly, the cross origin issue was something I havn't seen before and
		took me a while to figure out that a local server needs to be setup during local development when using resources from other origins.
		Next, I had trouble implementing OBJ/MTL models using OBJLoader. I was not able to figure out how to implement texture mapping onto OBJ files even after extensive reading
		so I ended up going to GLTF models. Even then, some of the bumpMap and roughness texture does not seem to render using the GLTFLoader (Earth is very round and shinny).
